## Environments
Development - Staging - Production

- Development
	+ Environment where software developer would spend the majority of their time. (Performance is less concern)

- Staging
	+ The code deployed here is tested to ensure that everything behaves and interacts as expected before being released to the next stage
	
- Production
	+ Environment that is exposed to the public and customers (no test files)
