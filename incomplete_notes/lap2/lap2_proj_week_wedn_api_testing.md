# Api testing

### Global variables

global.request = request


### Testing

beforeEach - runs before each test
beforeAll - runs before we start running tests

Need to make a separate DB and seed file to test specifically on our DB

Need to make a fn to reset db and seed at each iteration 
- Make it accessible globally together with request (require 'supertest') and app (requested from server declaration)
