# Regular Expressions in Python
Regular Expression (RE) is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern

Python builtin package:
`import re`

- You can search both the unicode strings (str) as well as 8-bit strings (bytes). However these cannot be mixed in patterns or in the find/replace function.
- To avoid issues with backslashes, feed in the 'raw' strings (add r before string eg r"raw string")

*For more complex functionalities* have a look a the third party package 'regex'

*TO CHECK EXPRESSION MATCHING* https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.11/Tools/demo/redemo.py




### *re* module commonly used methods:
`x = re.fn(r"regExpr", txt_to_be_searched)` -> Best using a raw string for the RE search as escape characters might be interpreted wrongly(r"string")
- findall
	+ Returns a _list_ containing all the matches
	+ finditer method is the same but returns an iterator     

- search
	+ Returns first occurrence of match in a _Match object_ if any (else None)
	+ match method works similar but only if at the beginning of string (useful only if applying multiline conditions)
	+ fullmatch methods is also similar, but searches for the entire string to be a match

- split
	+ Returns a _list_ where the string has been split at each match. Can add a third positional parameter to indicate the maximum number of splits

- sub
	+ Replaces one or many matches with a string. (re.sub("toFind", "toReplace", txt_to_be_searched))
	+ subn method is same as sub but returns a tuple (new_string, number_of_subs_made)

- compile('regExpr')
	+ Saves inserted regular expression for reuse, returns _Pattern object_ which is more efficient computationally

- escape(pattern)
	+ Returns regular expression escaped (just adds the \ to make sure you search exactly the inserted pattern)




### *re* module data structures
_Match object_
Match objects get returned as result of a successful search. It has several properties and methods. The most commons are:
- span() 
	+ Returns a tuple containing the start and end positions of the match

- string (property)
	+ Returns the string passed into the function (the one to be searched)

- group()
	+ Returns the part of the string where there was a match
	+ groups() -> returns a tuple containing all the subgroups of the match, from 1 to n

- start() - end() - span()
	+ Returns starting/ending/both(in tuple) positions of the match



_Pattern Object_
Pattern objects are compiled RE, which have methods for various operation, including pattern matches or string replacement. 
Declaration:
`p = re.compile('ab*')`
It also accepts optional _flags_ argument, used to enable special features and syntax variations (ex re.compile('ab*', re.IGNORECASE)).
Commonly used flags:
- ASCII, A
	+ Makes escaped characters (\n, \t, ..) match only on ASCII characters with the respective properties (newline, tab, ..)
- DOTALL, S
	+ Make . match any character, including newlines
- IGNORECASE, I
	+ Do case-insensitive matches
- LOCALE, L
	+ Do a locale-aware match (??)
- MULTILINE, M
	+ Multi-line matching, affecting ^ and $
- VERBOSE, X
	+ Enable verbose RE, to organise it more cleanly (look at documentation, it's a topic on its own)

Most commonly used *methods* for the pattern object include:
- match()
	+ Determine if RE matches at the beginning of the string. Returns Match object if found, None otherwise

- search()
	+ Determine if RE matches at any point of the string. Returns Match object if found, None otherwise

- findall()
	+ Find all substrings where the RE matches, and returns them as a list

- finditer()
	+ Find all substrings where the RE matches, and returns them as an iterator

- split(string, maxsplit)
	+ Identical to re.split()

- sub/subn(replacement_string, string, count)
	+ Identical to re.sub/subn()

- groups
	+ Number of capturing groups in the pattern

- pattern
	+ Pattern that constitutes the object





# Components of RE strings

### Metacharacters
- \ 
	+ Signals a special sequence or the escaping of a character ("\d")

- . 
	+ Any character (except newline character) ("he..o")

- ^ 
	+ Starts with ("^hello")

- $
	+ Ends with ("hello$")

- `*`
	+ Zero or more occurrences ("he`*`o") (refers to character preceding, so this would match "ho", "heeeeeeeo", but not "he" (bc it's missing the o))

- +
	+ One or more occurrences ("he+o") (same as above)
	+ `*+`, ++, ?+
	+ The `*, +, ?` quantifiers are all greedy, as they match as much text as possible. Adding _+_ at the end of the expression will cause an expression to become *possessive* and doesn't allow backtracking.

- ?
	+ Zero or one occurrence ("he?o") (same as above)
	+ `*?`, +?, ??
		* Adding _?_ after the quantifier makes it perform in *non-greedy (or minimal)* fashion; as few characters as possible will be matched

- {n}
	+ Exactly the specified number of occurrences ("hel{2}o") (same as above, it will match "hello", but not "helo")
	+ {m,n} - {m, }
		* You can also give a range of expected occurrences, or leave the range open to mean minimum 'm', no maximum 
	+ {m,n}?
		* Causes the resulting RE to match from m to n repetitions, attempting to match as _few_ as possible
	+ {m,n}+
		* Causes the resulting RE to match from m to n repetitions, attempting to match as _many_ as possible *without backtracking*

- | 
	+ Either or, it will match one of the two specified RE ("falls|stays") (it will match exactly falls OR stay)

- ()
	+ Capture and _GROUP_, used to group character as a single unit. Useful when searching >1 pattern per expression. 
	+ For example we want to search for uppercases and numbers in the same run, we could search for uppercase "[\bA-Z+\b]" and numbers "[\b0-9+]" (\b to indicate at beginning or end of word). Combined it comes up to: `"(\b[A-Z]+\b).+(\b\d+)"`
		* The .+ section is pretty much saying that before the group we have a bunch of characters (+ indicates that) that we can ignore
		* When using () with multiple groups of characters, we can use the _Match object_ method _.group(n)_ to indicate with n which group's results we want to extract. Ex our RE on the string "The price of PINEAPPLE ice cream is 20"; result.group(1) -> 'PINEAPPLE'; result.group(2) -> 20.

- (? )
	+ The question mark inside the parentheses acts as an extension notation. Its meaning depends on the character immediately to its right. There are several flags that can be included eg. (?aiLmsux):
		* a - Matches ASCII only
		* i - Ignore case
		* L - Locale dependent
		* m - Multi-line
		* s - Matches all
		* u - Matches unicode
		* x - Verbose
		* EXTRA: P -> Gives a name to a group eg `(?P<name>...)` to be able to access it later
			- (?:A)
				+ Matches the expression 'A', but cannot be retrieved (goes beyond me)
			- (?P=name)
				+ Matches the expression matched by an earlier group named 'name'
	+ (?>...)
		* Attempts to match ... as if it was a separate regular expression, and if successful, continues to match the rest of the pattern following it (Useful for advanced greedy stuff)
	+ (?#...)
		* Comment, not interpreted by the engine
	+ A(?=B)
		* Lookahead assertion which matches the expression 'A' _only if_ followed by 'B'
	+ A(?!B)
		* Negative lookahead assertion which matches A _only if NOT_ followed by 'B'
	+ (?<=B)A
		* Positive lookbehind assertion which matches the expression A, _only if_ 'B' is imeediately to its left (only matches fixed length expressions)
	+ (?<!B)A
		* Negative lookbehind assertion which matches the expression A _only if NOT_ immediately preceded by B
	+ (...)\1
		* The number corresponds to the first group to be matched. We can declare groups from 1 to 99 to run together and retrieve individually
	+ (?(name)yes-pattern|no-pattern)
		* Will try to match yes-pattern if the group indicated with the name exists, otherwise will try to match the no-pattern (which can be omitted)


- []
	+ A _SET_ of characters ("[a-m]"), different applications include
	+ [arn]
		* Match where one of the specified characters is present
	+ [a-n]
		* Match where there is a lower case, alphabetically between a and n
	+ [^arn]
		* Match everything EXCEPT a,r,n
	+ [0123]
		* Match where any of the specified digits are present
	+ [0-9]
		* Match any digit between 0 and 9
	+ `[0-5][0-9]`
		* Match any two digit number from 00 to 59
	+ [a-zA-Z]
		* Match any character upper or lower case
	+ [+]
		* Inside sets, `+, *, ., |, (), $, {}` have no special meaning, so [+] means return any match for + character in the string






### Special Sequences
- \A
	+ Returns a match if the following characters are at the beginning of the string ("\AThe")

- \b
	+ Returns a match where the specified characters are at the beginning or at the end of a word ("\bain" matches aint, "ain\b" matches pain)

- \B
	+ Returns a match where the characters are present *NOT* at the beginning (or end) of a word

- \d
	+ Returns a match where the string contains digits

- \D
	+ Returns a match where the string *DOESNT* contain digits

- \s
	+ Returns a match where the string contains a white space character

- \S
	+ Match where the string does *NOT* contain a white space character

- \w
	+ Returns a match where the string contains any word characters (eg a-z A-Z 0-9 and underscore character `_`)

- \W
	+ Returns a match where the string does *NOT* contain any word characters

- \Z
	+ Returns a match is the specified characters are at the end of the string
