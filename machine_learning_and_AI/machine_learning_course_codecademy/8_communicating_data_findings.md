Supervised Learning is where the data is labeled and the program learns to predict the output from the input data. For instance, a supervised learning algorithm for credit card fraud detection would take as input a set of recorded transactions. For each transaction, the program would predict if it is fraudulent or not.


Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the program learns the inherent structure of the data based on unlabeled examples.
Clustering is a common unsupervised machine learning approach that finds patterns and structures in unlabeled data by grouping them into clusters.



The process of machine learning consists of:

- Formulating a Question
- Finding and Understanding the Data
- Cleaning the Data and Feature Engineering
	+ Feature engineering is the process by which we choose the important features (columns) to look at. We also might normalise, augmenting data by adding a new column, remove unnecessary columns
- Choosing a Model
	+ If we're looking for a continuous output (predicting a number) we should use a regression algorithm
	+ If we're looking to classify an input, we use a classification algorithm
- Tuning and Evaluating
- Using the Model and Presenting Results
