# Emmet Abbreviations

## What are these things now??

Emmet snippets and expansion are short hand methods for writing blocks of typical repetitive code quickly. Learning some of these writing shortcuts will reduce development time drastically.

They work by typing out a key word in your code. A suggestion will then appear which you can select with Tab, and the code will be auto-populated on screen.

Combined with the multi-cursor feature in VS Code, complex code can be created in multiple locations simultaneously.
