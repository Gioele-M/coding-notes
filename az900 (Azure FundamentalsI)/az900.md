## Azure cloud concepts

### Cloud models
- Define cloud computing
	+ Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, such as computing, networking, storage and analytics

- Public cloud
	+ Owned by cloud services or hosting provider, usually accessible to public
	+ Organisation only pay for what they use

- Private cloud
	+ Owned by organisation and completely managed by them
	+ Required to buy hardware by organisation

- Hybrid cloud 
	+ Mix of the both


*Cloud benefits*
- High availability
- Scalability
	+ Horizontal or vertical
- Global Reach
- Agility
	+ React quickly to demand
- Fault tolerance
	+ It keeps running even if there is 1 component not working
- Elasticity
	+ Returns to baseline when excess resources are not needed
- Customer latency capabilities
- Predictive cost consideration


*Expenditure models*
- Capital expenditure
	+ Is the upfront spending of money on physical infrastructure
- Operational expenditure
	+ The spending and billing of services as needed



*Cloud services*
As it goes down you manage less and less
- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
	+ Pay as you go IT infrastructure by renting servers, virtual machines, storage etc
	+ Flexibility
	
- Platform as service (PaaS)
	+ Gives environment for building, testing and deploying without managing infrastructure
	+ Development
	
- Software as service (SaaS)
	+ Usage of software to work ex microsoft office 365 etc
	+ Pay as you go







## Core Azure Services
Azure pairs a backup data centre when you subscribe to reduce down time. 
Many different options to reduce downtimes if you need



### Azure resources
- Virtual machines
- Storage accounts
- Virtual networks
- App services


*A resource group is a container to manage and aggregate resources in a single unit*



## Azure resource manager _(ARM)_
Offers a layer that enables creating, udating and deleting resources in the azure subscription



### Azure subscription
Gives access with authenticated access to accounts
- Billing boundary: generate separate billing reports












# Portal.azure.com






# Azure compure services
On-demand computing services such as disks, processors, memory ,networking and os
- Virtual machines
	+ Software emulation of physical computers (SaaS)
	+ You can chose an availability zone when instancing one so to reduce eventual downtime
	+ You can create templates for it and leave open ports to SSH from public
	

- Serverless computing 
	+ They run as needed when needed (VM is always running)
	+ Used for web apps and APIs (PaaS)
	+ Azure functions
		* Event based code running your service and not the underlying infrastructure
	+ Azure logic apps
		* Orchestrate tasks and processes, as well as workflows to integrate apps
	+ Azure containers
		* Vitrualised environment that can respond to changes on demand (PaaS)
	+ Kubernetes service
		* Service for orchestrating containers
	


- Virtual Desktop
	+ Virtual networks
		* Enables azure comunication over the internet
	+ Virtual private network (vpn)
		* Same as before but more protected 
	+ Azure express route
		* Private connection





- Azure cosmos database
	+ NoSql db that is elastic and independently scaled
- Azure SQL DB
- Azure DB for MySQL
- Azure DB for PostgreSQL
- Azure marketplace
	+ +10000 services
	+ 





























# Internet of things (IoT)
The ability for devices to gather and relay info for data analysis
- Azure IoT central
- Azure IoT hub
- Azure sphere


## Big data analytics
- Azure synapse analytics
	+ Cloud based enterprise data warehouse
- Azure HDInshight
	+ Fully managed open source analytics services
- Azure databricks
	+ Apache spark based analytics service
	
- Azure machine learning
	+ Cloud based to develop, train and deploy models
- Cognitive services
	+ Enable apps to see, hear, speak, understand and interpret user needs
- Azure bot service
	+ Develop inteligent, enterprise-grade bots
	

- Azure DevOps
	+ Development collaboration tools
- Github
- GitHub Actions fro azure
	+ Automate workflow to deploy from github
- Azure DevTest labs
	+ Create environments







# Azure resource manager (ARM) templates
Templates are JSON files used to deploy infrastructure starting from templates




# Azure monitor
Maximised the avilability and performance of application and services, by collecting, analysing and acting on telemetry from cloud and on-premises environments.
