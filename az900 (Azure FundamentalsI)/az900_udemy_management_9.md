	+ Free
- Developer
- Standard
- Professional direct
Obviously the higher you go, the higher you pay, the better service you get


*Service level agreement*
Guaranteed uptime for your services, if they don't respect it, they refund the money
(Services need to offer guaranteed SLA) -> they get compounted by multiplying the SLAs (ex 99.99% â€¢ 99.99% = 99.95%)
